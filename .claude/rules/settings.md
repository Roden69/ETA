### The settings tab

**A menu of titles, and a page behind each** (step 38's second round — the tab
had become every box under every other). `SettingsPage` lists the pages in menu
order under three section labels; the menu shows titles and nothing else, a tap
opens the page, "‹ Einstellungen" or the system back returns. The page is held
by name in `rememberSaveable`. Urlaubsmodus is a row that leads straight to its
flow, Wertverfall and Absagen are listed only while the points are on, and
Tutorial is the last row, under Debug. The tutorial page lists every tutorial;
the ones about a single subject (`FeatureTutorialsBox`) are mounted a second
time under the Advanced Features switches, where "what is this?" gets asked.

- **Saving stays explicit, per page.** `SettingsViewModel.dirty` compares the
  draft with the stored row: a page offers "Sichern" (grey while there is
  nothing to save) and "Verwerfen". A page can be left with its answers changed
  — by the tab bar as well — so **the menu says "Ungesicherte Änderungen"**
  with the same two buttons; the draft is one for all pages, and so is the
  save. `setFeature` applies its change to both sides, so a switch flipped is
  never "unsaved".
- The boxes themselves are unchanged and still carry their own headings; what
  follows describes them.

`ui/settings/` holds the standing configuration, away from planning a day. **The
questionnaire's own step composables are reused**, not reimplemented: they are
already `(draft, onChange)` pairs, so every answer is asked for in exactly one place
and cannot drift between the two screens. The draft stays null until the stored
answers arrive, so there is never a set of defaults on screen that the user might
save by accident.

**Since step 18 only the answers that are configuration are here**: sleep and
morning, the wake alarm, the still-active question, the planning times,
the four "Advanced Features" switches (`AdvancedFeaturesBox` — see *Step 36*; they
apply at once, and the points one folds the next two away), inflation and the cancellation rate. Meals, housekeeping, sport, free time,
mindfulness and work are standing *tasks* and are edited on the Listen tab. Saving
goes through `SetupRepository.saveSettings`, which regenerates only bed preparation
and the morning (`SETTINGS_OWNED_ITEM_IDS`: `setup:bedprep`, `setup:morning`), never `complete` — calling `complete`
here would overwrite every edit made on the Listen tab. The weekly social budget and its `SocialTimeBox` were removed in step 38, and
`SettingsMessage.Saved` lost its conflict
count, `UserSetup.conflicts()` having described answers that no longer describe the
schedule.

**Individual nights** are stored in `UserSetup.nightOverrides`, keyed by wake day.
The sleep page lists these under "Einzelne Nächte" with bedtime, wake-up and reset
to the weekday/weekend pattern. Pattern edits leave explicit corrections intact.
`SettingsViewModel.save` refuses a sleep-free gap longer than 24 hours, including
Sunday into Monday, and leaves the stored setup unchanged with a visible error.
The wake-alarm card describes each day's actual wake-up instead of claiming a
single hour when corrections exist.

The **Design** card at the top chooses the look and applies at once, outside the
draft — see *Step 30*. The tab also holds the Alarme card (*The planning alarm*), the ignored calendar
events, vacation mode, the open-days catch-up and the debug reset.

**Where the data lives.** `BackupService` writes the whole database to a file the
user picks and reads it back. The live database does **not** move, and the screen
says so: scoped storage hands out document URIs and SQLite needs a path it can lock,
so an app cannot keep a working database in a folder of the user's choosing, and a
setting that looked like it moved the database and did not would be worse than none.
An automatic backup to a remembered folder is the natural next step and would need a
persisted tree URI. Two things the backup gets right that are easy to get wrong: all
three SQLite files travel together in one zip, because copying only `erik.db` while
write-ahead logging is on hands back a database missing the newest writes — precisely
the ones the user just made; and a restore only overwrites the files this app owns, a
zip entry naming a path elsewhere being ignored. Afterwards the app must be
**restarted**, because Room still holds the old files open, and the screen says so
rather than pretending the swap took effect.

**Debug reset** wipes every table via `ResetDao`, which thereby sends the app back to
the questionnaire. `ResetDao` lists its tables by hand on purpose, so a new table is
a visible omission rather than something that silently survives a reset. Note that
view models outlive the screen swap: anything the setup view model latches (its
`saving` flag) has to be cleared, or the reset comes back to a stuck questionnaire.

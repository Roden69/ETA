/**
 * Subtasks: the steps inside a task, and which of them a day has ticked off.
 *
 * Two tables and not one column, because a subtask belongs to the task while a
 * tick belongs to one occurrence of it — the same split the whole model rests on.
 * Nothing on `items` changes: a task with no rows in `subtasks` is a group with an
 * empty list, which is why every card in the database is already one.
 *
 * - **`subtasks`**: `itemId` cascades, so deleting a card takes its steps with it.
 *   `position` is the order the builder put them in, not unique per item — saving a
 *   reordered list writes several rows and a unique index would make their order
 *   matter.
 * - **`subtask_checks`**: the row's existence is the tick. Composite key over
 *   (`blockId`, `subtaskId`), both cascading: a block cleared by an edit to its
 *   standing task takes its ticks with it, and so does a deleted step.
